It is the size a vitamin pill and has a miniature camera contained in it. </p>
    <p>The PillCam video capsule allows your doctor to see your entire small intestine – an organ you could never fully see before this capsule was developed. It also helps your doctor determine the cause of many unresolved symptoms such as <a style="text-decoration:none" href="/areasOfExpertise/abdominalPainSyndrome">abdominal pain</a>, <a style="text-decoration:none" href="/areasOfExpertise/diarrhealDiseases">diarrhea</a>, bleeding or anemia. The small intestine is primarily responsible for digesting food and is the source of many of these unexplained symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After you arrive at the doctor’s office the nurse or doctor will attach sensors to your stomach with an adhesive so they won’t come off. These sensors allow the video capsule to wirelessly transmit images of your small intestine. You will then be asked to put a Velcro belt on with a data recorder attached to it. This recorder is the size of a CD walkman and actually stores all the pictures taken by the video capsule. You will then be asked to swallow the vitamin-sized video capsule with a glass of water. Once the nurse or doctor has determined that you have successfully swallowed the video capsule you will be allowed to leave the office for the remainder of the day. You return to the office approximately 8 hours later to return the data recorder and to have the sensors removed from your stomach. Your doctor then loads the pictures stored on the data recorder to his or her computer to review. The doctor will then call you to walk through the results.&nbsp;</p>
